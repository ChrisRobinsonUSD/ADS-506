Global warming is a major concern, and as time progresses global warming leads to climate change. 
Intend of this project was to create ARIMA models for variable of importance in order to forecast values based on past data.
In addition, machine learning model(s) were created in an attempt to forecast future climate trends in order to predict potential challenges to local bird populations.
